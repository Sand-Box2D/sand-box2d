# Sand-Box2D Documentation
This directory (hosted inside the game's repo)
contains everything you need to know about contributing to Sand-Box2D.

Let's get you around:

## Dev Instructions
* [Build/](./build) - build instructions for each platform and some info about them.
* [Cross-Platform](./cross-platform.md) - refer to this file if you want to write platform-specific code.

## Conventions
In order to simplify the dev's life when one has to create and name something
and in order to effectively use the fact that we're refactoring the full project,
these strong rules were defined. Please refer to them when contributing.

* [Naming Conventions](./naming.md) - various conventions for naming files/classes/etc.
* [Comment Conventions](./comments.md) - conventions about commenting your code.
